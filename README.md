# Why Rust? 
Rust, a fairly new, and hacky language when it comes to cross thread memory sharing
is however not only faster than C++ in most cases, it's more memory safe, less prone to uncaught exceptions, errors and the like. 
This is what makes Rust so amazing. 

# How do I compile? 
Just move into the project file you'd like to compile, and type
``cargo build --release``

# What Rust version is this built on?
All projects in this repo are supposed to be compiled with the latest rust nightly build. 

# Your code is terrible
It might be, if you find anything that's highly retarded make sure to make a pull request!
